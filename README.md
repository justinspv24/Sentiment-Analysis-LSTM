# Sentiment-Analysis-LSTM

## Overview

This project implements sentiment analysis using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The project is divided into two main components:
1. **Training the Model:** A Jupyter notebook that trains an LSTM model to perform sentiment analysis on yelp dataset.
2. **Testing the Model:** A separate Jupyter notebook that uses the trained model to predict sentiment on new input data.

## Dataset

The Yelp dataset is a subset of our businesses, reviews, and user data for use in connection with academic research. Available as JSON files, use it to teach students about databases, to learn NLP, or for sample production data while you learn how to make mobile apps.

For this project, a subset of approximately 1 million reviews was extracted from the Yelp dataset to train the model.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter

You can install the required packages using the following command:
