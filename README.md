# Sentiment-Analysis-LSTM

## Overview

This project implements sentiment analysis using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The project is divided into two main components:
1. **Training the Model:** A Jupyter notebook that trains an LSTM model to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset.
2. **Testing the Model:** A separate Jupyter notebook that uses the trained model to predict sentiment on new input data.
